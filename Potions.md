# Potions

To help our player out we are going to add potions/powerups to our gameplay.

We are going to be making 3 different types of potions:
- Health potion: Recovers some of players health
- Speed potion: Increases players moving speed
- Jump potion: Increases the players jump height

The prefabs used to represent the potions are from the mentioned asset in README
