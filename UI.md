# UI

## Game Play UI
For our in game UI, we decided to incorporate:
1. healthbar: so our players can keep track of how much health they have left
2. key counter: to keep track how many keys have been found 
3. potion usage: texts to let the player know which potions they've consumed 
4. gate notice: text that notifies the player when the gate is officially opened(when they've collected all the keys)
